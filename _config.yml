about_me_description: I'm Kevin Tao, a highly motivated computer science student at SUNY at Stony Brook, with a focus on full stack web development, software engineering, and data science. With a 3.87 GPA, I'm a recipient of the Stony Brook Foundation Trustee Scholarship and have been accepted into the Computer Science honors program. I have strong problem-solving, analytical, and critical thinking skills and am proficient in a variety of programming languages and tools, including Java, JavaScript, C++, Git, and MySQL, among others. I've completed several impressive projects, including maintaining and enhancing a Discord bot written in JavaScript and implementing a problem solver in C that uses multiple worker processes to concurrently solve computationally intensive problems. I'm a creative, detail-oriented, and effective communicator who thrives in team-oriented environments and is passionate about technology and software development. In my spare time, I love to expand my knowledge of computer science and work on personal coding projects. You can find some of my projects on my <a class="highlight-link" href="https://github.com/xSpoonN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub page</a>.
