- name: Roomba Simulation
  descr: "Collaborated with a team to develop a simulation of a Roomba vacuum cleaner in C++. Leveraged the C++ standard library to implement a 2D grid of rooms, with each room containing a set of dirt particles. Successfully designed and implemented a Roomba class that could move around the grid, clean dirt particles, and return to the charging station using a smart and efficient algorithm. The simulation gives visual feedback of the Roomba's movements and statuses. Later extended the simulator to handle and simulate multiple house input files and multiple algorithms concurrently to compare their efficiency."
